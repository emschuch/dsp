If you ever get close to a human
and human behaviour
be ready to get confused

there's definitely no logic 
to human behaviour
but yet so irresistible

there is no map 
to human behaviour

they're terribly moody 
then all of a sudden turn happy
but, oh, to get involved in the exchange
of human emotions is ever so satisfying

there's no map and
a compass
wouldn't help at all

human behaviour


i travel 
all around the city 
go in and out of
locomotives
all alone

there's no-one here
and people everywhere

crying 'cause i need you
crying i can feel you
crying 'cause i need you
crying cause i care

it's a hot day
and i'm dressed lightly
i move carfully
trough the crowd
here everyone 
is so vulnerable
and i'm as well

there's no-one here
and people everywhere

crying 'cause i need you
crying i can feel you
crying 'cause i need you
crying cause i care

only if a ship would sail in
or just someone came
and knocked at my door
or just (or just) something

crying 'cause i need you 

crying 'cause i need you


his wicked sense of humour
suggests exciting sex
his fingers focus on her
touches, he's venus as a boy

he believes in beauty
he's venus as a boy

he's exploring
the taste of her
arousal
so accurate
he sets off
the beauty in het
he's venus as a boy

he believes in beauty
he's venus as a boy


come on girl 
let's sneak out of this party
it's getting boring
there's more to life than this
it's still early morning
we could go down to the harbour 
and jump between the boats
and see the sun come up

we could nick a boat 
and sneak off to this island
i could bring my little ghettoblaster
there's more to life than this
but we'd have to rush back
to the towns best baker
to get the first bread of the morning
there's more to life than this


Lately
I find myself out gazing at stars
Hearing guitars
Like someone in love

Sometimes the things I do astound me
Mostly whenever you're around me

Lately
I seem to walk as though I have wings
Bump into things
Like someone in love
Each time I look at you I'm limp as a glove
And feeling like someone in love 

Sometimes the things I do astound me
Mostly whenever you're around me

Lately
I seem to walk as though I have wings
Bump into things
Like someone in love
Each time I look at you I'm limp as a glove
And feeling like someone in love 
Like someone in love 
Like someone in love


i can sense it 
something important
is about to happen 
it's coming up

it takes courage to enjoy it
the hardcore and the gentle
big time sensuality

we just met 
and i know i'm a bit too intimate
but something huge is coming up
and we're both included

it takes courage to enjoy it
the hardcore and the gentle
big time sensuality

i don't know my future after this weekend
and i don't want to

it takes courage to enjoy it
the hardcore and the gentle
big time sensuality


one day 
it will happen 
one day, one day
it will all come true

one day
when you're ready
one day, one day
when you're up to it

the atmosphere 
will get lighter
and two suns ready
to shine just for you

i can feel it

one day
it will happen
one day. one day
it will all make sense

one day, one day
you will blossom
one day, one day
when you're ready

an aeroplane 
will curve gracefully
around the volcano
with the eruption that never lets you down

i can feel it

and the beautifullest
fireworks are burning
in the sky just for you

i can feel it

one day
one day


I can not live
peacefully without you
for even a moment
l miss you terribly
when you're away

he's away
this ain't right
I'm alone

I'm taking an aeroplane
across the world
to follow my heart

how come
out of all the people in the world
only one
can make me complete
one word on the phone
makes me happy
but one touch directly
makes me ecstatic

he's away
this ain't right
I'm alone
I'm taking an aeroplane
across the world
to follow my heart


come to me
i'll take care of you
protect you
calm, calm down
you're exhausted
come lie down
you don't have to explain
i understand

you know
that i adore you
you know
that i love you
so don't make me say it
it would burst the bubble
break the charm

jump off
your building's on fire
i'll catch you
i'll catch you
destroy all that is keeping you down
and then i'll nurse you
i'll nurse you

come to me
i'll take care of you
you don't have to explain
i understand


since i met you
this small town hasn't got room
for my big feelings

violently happy 
'cause i love you

violently happy
but you're not here

violently happy
come calm me down
before i get into trouble

i tip-toe down to the shore
stand by the ocean
make it roar at me
and i roar back

violently happy
'cause i love you 

violently happy
but you're not here

violently happy
overemotional

violently happy
i'll get into trouble
real soon
if you don't get here
baby


i live by the ocean
and during the night 
i dive into it
down to the bottom 
underneath all currents
and drop my anchor

and this is where i'm staying

this is my home


darling stop confusing me
with your wishful thinking
hopeful enbraces
don't you understand?
i have to go through this
i belong to here where
no-one cares and no-one loves
no light no air to live in
a place called hate
the city of fear

i play dead 
it stops the hurting
i play dead
and hurting stops

it's sometimes just like sleeping
curling up inside my private tortures
i nestle into pain
hug suffering
caress every ache

i play dead
it stops the hurting


stand up
you've got to manage
i won't sympathize
anymore

and if you complain once more
you'll meet an army of me

you're allright
there's nothing wrong
self-sufficience please!
and get to work

and if you complain once more
you'll meet an army of me

you're on your own now
we won't save you
your rescue-squad 
is too exhausted

and if you complain once more
you'll meet an army of me


we live on a mountain
right at the top
there's a beautiful view
from the top of the mountain
every morning i walk towards the edge
and throw little things off
like:
car-parts, bottles and cutlery
or whatever i find lying around

it's become a habit 
a way
to start the day

i go through this 
before you wake up
so i can feel happier
to be safe up here with you

it's real early morning
no-one is awake
i'm back at my cliff
still throwing things off
i listen to the sounds they make
on their way down
i follow with my eyes 'til they crash
imagine what my body would sound like
slamming against those rocks

and when it lands
will my eyes
be closed or open?

i'll go through all this
before you wake up
so i can feel happier
to be safe up here with you


all the modern things
like cars and such
have always existed

they've just been waiting in a mountain
for the right moment

listening to the irritating noises
of dinosaurs and people
dabbling outside

all the modern things
have always existed
they've just been waiting

to come out
and multiply
and take over

it's their turn now...


it's. oh. so quiet
it'a oh. so still
you're all alone
and so peaceful until...

you fall in love
zing boom
the sky up above
zing boom
is caving in
wow bam
you've never been so nuts about a guy
you wanna laugh you wanna cry
you cross your heart and hope to die

'til it's over and then
it's nice and quiet 
but soon again
starts another big riot

you blow a fuse
zing boom
the devil cuts loose
zing boom
so what's the use
wow bam
of falling in love

it's. oh. so quiet
it's. oh. so still
you're all alone
and so peaceful until...

you ring the bell
bim bam
you shout and you yell
hi ho ho
you broke the spell
gee. this is swell you almost have a fit
this guy is "gorge" and i got hit
there's no mistake this is it

'til it's over and then
it's nice and quiet
but soon again
starts another big riot

you blow a fuse
zing boom
the devil cuts loose
zing boom
so what's the use
wow bam
of falling in love

the sky caves in
the devil cuts loose
you blow blow blow blow blow your fuse
when you've fallen in love

ssshhhhhh...

and i have no fear

i wish i'd only smell this
and didn't have to taste

how can i ignore?
this is sex whitout touching
i'm going to explore
i'm only into this to

enjoy

your flirt finds me out
teases the crack in me
smittens me with hope

possibly maybe probably love

as much as i definitely enjoy solitude
i wouldn't mind perhaps 
spending little time with you
sometimes
sometimes

possibly maybe probably love

uncertainly excites me
baby
who knows what's going to happen?
lottery or car crash
or you'll join a cult

possibly maybe probably love

mon petit vulcan
you're eruptions and disasters
i keep calm
admiring your lava
i keep calm

possibly maybe probably love

since we broke up
i'm using lipstick again
i'll suck my tongue
as a remembrance of you


i miss you
but i haven't met you yet
so special
but it hasn't happened yet
you are gorgeous
but i haven't met you yet
i remember 
but it hasn't happened yet

and if you believe in dreams 
or what is more important
that a dream can come true
i will meet you

i was peaking
but it hasn't happened yet
i haven't been given
my best souvenir
i miss you
but i haven't met you yet
i know your habits
but wouldn't recognize you yet

and if you believe in dreams 
or what is more important
that a dream can come true
i will meet you

i'm so impatient 
i can't stand the wait 
when will i get my cuddle?
who are you?

i know by now that you'll arrive
by the time i stop waiting

i miss you


while i crawl into the unknown
cover me
i'm going hunting for mysteries
cover me

i'm going to prove the possible really exists

this is really dangerous
cover me
but worth all the effort
cover me

i'm going to prove the impossible really exists


genius to fall asleep to your tape last night
sounds go through the muscles
these abstract wordless movements
they start off cells that haven't been touched
before

these cells are virgins

my headphones
they saved my life
your tape
it lulled me to sleep

nothing will be the same

i'm fast asleep

i like this resonance
it elevates me
i don't recognize myself
this is very interesting

my headphones
they saved my life
your tape
it lulled me to sleep

i'm fast asleep now

i'm fast asleep

my headphones
they saved my life
your tape
it lulled me to sleep


if travel is searching
and home has been found

i'm not stopping

i'm going hunting
i'm the hunter
i'll bring back the goods
but i don't know when

thought that i could organise freedom
how scandinavian of me
you sussed it out, didn't you?

you could smell it
so you left me on my own
to complete the mission
now i'm leaving it all behind

i'm going hunting
i'm the hunter...

(you just didn't know me!)

(you just didn't know me!)


All these accidents that happen
Follow the dots
Coincidence makes sense only with you
You don't have to speak
I feel

Emotional landscapes
They puzzle me
The riddle gets solved
And you push me up to

This state of emergency
How beautiful to be!
State of emergency
Is where I want to be.

All that no one sees you see
What's inside of me
Every nerve that hurts you heal
Deep inside of me
You don't have to speak
I feel

Emotional landscapes
They puzzle me
Confuse
Can the riddle get solved?
And you push me up to this...

State of emergency
How beautiful to be!
State of emergency
Is where I want to be

while you are away
my heart comes undone
slowly unravels
in a ball of yarn
the devil collects it
with a grin
our love
in a ball of yarn

he'll never return it

so when you come back
we'll have to make new love


I'm a fountain of blood
In the shape of a girl
You're the bird on the brim
Hypnotised by the Whirl

Drink me, make me feel real
Wet your beak in the stream
Game we're playing is life
Love is a two way dream

Leave me now, return tonight
Tide will show you the way
If you forget my name
You will go astray
Like a killer whale
Trapped in a bay

I'm a path of cinders
Burning under your feet
You're the one who walks me 
I'm your one way street 

I'm a whisper in water
Secret for you to hear
You are the one who grows distant
When I beckon you near

Leave me now, return tonight
The tide will show you the way
If you forget my name
You will go astray
Like a killer whale
Trapped in a bay

I'm a tree that grows hearts
One for each that you take
You're the intruder hand
I'm the branch that you break


Not 'til you halo all over me
I'll come over
Not 'til it shimmers 'round your skull
I'll be yours

I weave for you
The marvellous web
Glow in the dark threads
All neon like

The cocoon surrounds you
Embraces all
So you can sleep
Foetus-style

And they will assist us
'Cause we're asking for help
And the luminous beam 
It feeds you,
Henh-yeah!, henh-yeah

The soft distortion
Fills you up
Nourish nourish
Your turtleheart

And they will assist us
'Cause we're asking for help
And the luminous beam 
It feeds you
Henh-yeah!, yeah!

Don't get angry with yourself
Don't, don't get angry with yourself
I'll heal you

With a razorblade 
I'll cut a slit open
And the luminous beam
Feeds you honey, heals you 

Don't get angry with yourself

I'll heal you, i'll heal you 
luminous, i'll heal you


You think you're denying me of something
Well I've got plenty
You're the one who's missing out
But you won't notice
'Til after five years
If you'll live that long
You'll wake up 
All loveless

I dare you
To take me on
I dare you
To show me your palms

I'm so bored with cowards
That say they want
Then they can't handle

You can't handle love
You can't handle love
You just can't handle

I dare you
To take me on
I dare you
To show me your palms

What's so scary ?
Not a threat in sight
You just can't handle
You can't handle love

You can't handle love, baby
You can't handle love
It's obvious
You can't handle

I dare you
To take me on
I dare you
To show me your palms

I'm so bored of cowards
That say they want
Then they can't handle

You can't handle love, baby
You can't handle love,
It's obvious
You can't handle

I dare you, I dare you
I dare you, I dare you


How could I be so immature ?
To think he could replace,
The missing elements in me,
How extremely lazy of me 

How could I be so immature ?
To think he could replace,
The missing elements in me,
How extremely lazy of me.

How could I be so immature ?
How could I be so immature ?


I have walked this earth 
And watched people 

It doesn't scare me at all 

I can be sinsere 
And say I like them 

It doesn't scare me at all 

You can't say no to hope 
Can't say no to happiness 

I want to go on a mountain-top 
With a radio and good batteries 
And play a joyous tune and 
Free the human race
From suffering 

It doesn't scare me at all 

I'm no fucking buddhist 
But this is enlightenment 

The less room you give me 
The more space I've got

It doesnt scare me at all 

You can't say no to hope 
Can't say no to happiness 

It doesn't scare me at all 

I want to be on a mountain-top 
With a radio and good batteries 
And play a joyous tune and 
Free the
A-human race 
From suffering 

It doesn't scare me at all 

This is an alarm-call
So wake-up, wake-up now
Today has never happened 
And it doesnt frighten me 

It doesn't scare me at all 

You can't say no to hope 
You can't say no to happiness 

It doesn't scare me at all


Excuse me
But I just have to
Explode
Explode this body
Off me

I'll be brand new
Brand new tomorrow
A little bit tired
But brand new


You'll be given love
You'll be taken care of
You'll be given love
You have to trust it

Maybe not from the sources
You have poured yours
Maybe not from the directions
You are staring at

Twist your head around
It's all around you
All is full of love
All around you

All is full of love
You just ain't receiving
All is full of love
Your phone is off the hook
All is full of love
Your doors are all shut
All is full of love!

All is full of love
All is full of love
All is full of love
All is full of love
All is full of love


Through the warmthest
Cord of care
Your love was sent to me

I'm not sure
What to do with it
Or where to put it

I'm so close to tears
And so close to
Simply calling you up
I'm simply suggesting

We go to the hidden place
That we go to the hidden place
We go to the hidden place
We go to a hidden place

Now I have
Been slightly shy
And I can smell a pinch of hope
To almost have allowed once fingers
To stroke
The fingers I was given to touch with
But careful, careful
There lies my passion, hidden
There lies my love
I'll hide it under a blanket
Lull it to sleep

I'll keep it in a hidden place
I'll keep it in a hidden place
Keep it in a hidden place
Keep it in a hidden place

He's the beautifullest
Fragilest
Still strong
Dark and divine
And the littleness of his movements
Hides himself
He invents a charm that makes him invisible
Hides in the air
Can I hide there too?
Hide in the air of him
Seek solace
Sanctuary

In the hidden place
In a hidden place
In a hidden place
We'll stay in a hidden place
Ooohh in a hidden place
We'll live in a hidden place
We'll be in a hidden place
In a hidden place


Who would have known
That a boy like him
Would have entered me lightly
Restoring my blisses

Who would have known
That a boy like him
After sharing my core
Would stay going nowhere

Who would have known
A beauty this immense
Who would have known
A saintly trance
Who would have known
Miraculous breath
To inhale a beard
Loaded with courage

Who would have known
That a boy like him
Possessed of magical
Sensitivity
Who would approach a girl like me
Who caresses cradles his head
In her bosom

He slides inside
Half awake, half asleep
We faint back
Into sleephood
When I wake up
The second time
In his arms
Gorgeousness
He's still inside me

Who would have known
Who ahhh
Who would have known

A train of pearls
Cabin by cabin
Is shot precisely
Across an ocean

From a mouth
From a
From the mouth
Of a girl like me
To a boy
To a boy
To a boy


I wake up
And the day feels
Broken
I tilt my head
I'm trying to get an angle
'Cause the evening
I've always longed for
It could still happen

How do I master
The perfect day
Six glasses of water
Seven phonecalls

If you leave it alone
It might just happen
Anyway

It's not up to you
Oh it never really was
It's not up to you
Oh it never really was
It's not up to you
Well it never really was
It's not up to you

If you wake up
And the day feels
Ah broken
Just lean into the crack
(Just lean into the crack)
And it will tremble
Ever so nicely
Notice
How it sparkles
Down there

I can decide
What I give
But it's not up to me
What I get given
Unthinkable surprises
About to happen
But what they are

It's not up to you
Well it never really was
It's not up to you
Oh it never really was
It's not up to you
Oh it never really was
It's not up to you
Oh, me, share
It's not up to you
It's not up to you
Oh, it never really was
It's not up to you
Well, it never really was
It's not up to you
It's not up to you
It's not up to you
It's not up to you

There's too much
Clinging
To peak
There's too much
Pressure


It's not meant to be a strife
It's not meant to be a struggle uphill
Oh I

It's not meant to be a strife
It's not meant to be a struggle uphill
Oh I

You're trying too hard
Surrender
Give yourself in
You're trying too hard
You're trying too hard, ah

It's not meant to be a strife
It's not meant to be a struggle uphill
Sweetly
It's not meant to be as dry
To enjoy
It's not meant to be a stuggle uphill
Oh I

It's warmer now
Lean into it
Unfold
Unfold in a generous way
Surrender

It's not meant to be as dry (surrender)
It's not meant (undo) to be a struggle uphill (undo)
It's not meant to be as dry
It's not meant to be a struggle uphill

I'm praying
To be
In a generous mode
The kindness kind
The kindness kind
To share
Me
To share me

It's not meant to be as dry
It's not meant to be a struggle uphill

It's not meant to be as dry
It's not meant to be a struggle uphill

Undo
Undo
If you're bleeding
Undo
And if you're sweating
Undo
If you're crying, darling

Oh I
Unravel


Pedalling through
The dark currents
I find
An accurate copy
A blueprint
Of the pleasure
In me

Swirling black lilies totally ripe
A secret code carved
Swirling black lilies totally ripe
A secret code carved

He offers
A handshake
Crooked
Five fingers
They form a pattern
Yet to be matched

On the surface simplicity
But the darkest pit in me
It's pagan poetry
Pagan poetry

Morsecoding signals (signals)
They pulsate (wake me up) and wake me up
(pulsate) from my hibernating

On the surface simplicity
Swirling black lilies totally ripe
But the darkest pit in me
It's pagan poetry
Swirling black lilies totally ripe
Pagan poetry

Swirling black lilies totally ripe

I love him, I love him
I love him, I love him
I love him, I love him
I love him, I love him
She loves him, she loves him

This time
She loves him, she loves him
I'm gonna keep it to myself
She loves him, she loves him
She loves him, she loves him
This time
I'm gonna keep me all to myself
She loves him, she loves him
And he makes me want to hand myself over
She loves him, she loves him
She loves him, she loves him
And he makes me want to hand myself over


Threading
The glacier head
Looking hard for
Moments of shine
From twilight
To twilight
Utter mundane

Aurora
Goddess sparkle
Shoot me
Beyond this suffer
The need
Is great
Aurora
Utter mundane

Aurora
Goddess sparkle
A mountain shade
Suggests your shape
I tumbled down
On my knees
Fill the mouth
With snow
The way it melts
I wish
To melt
Into you
Aurora
Utter mundane

Spark the sun off
Spark the sun off
Spark the sun off
Spark the sun off me


She touched
My arm
And smiled

One of these days
Soon
Very soon
Love you 'til then
Love you 'til then

Feel my breath
On your neck
And your heart
Will race

Don't say no to me
You can't say no to me
I won't see you
Denied

I'm sorry you saw that
I'm sorry he did it
An echo
A stain
A stain

I can't say no to you
I can't say no to you
Say nothing

Free falling
Complete


I will wade out
Till my thighs are steeped
In burning flowers
I will take the sun in my mouth
And leap into the ripe air
Alive with closed eyes
To dash against darkness

In the sleeping curves of my body
Shall enter fingers
Of smooth mastery
With chasteness of sea-girls
Will I complete the mystery
Of my flesh
Will I complete the mystery
Of my flesh
My flesh


I have a recurrent dream
Everytime I loose my voice
I swallow little glowing lights
My mother and son baked for me

And during the night
They do a trapeze walk
Until they're in the sky
Right above my bed

While I'm asleep
My mother and son pour into me
Warm glowing oil
Into my wide open throat

I have a recurrent dream
Everytime I feel a hoarseness
I swallow warm glowing lights
My mother and son baked for me, oh

They make me feel so much better
They make me feel better

We have a recurrent dream
Everytime we loose our voices
We dream swallow little lights
Our mother and son bake for us

During the night
They do a little trapeze walk
Until they're in the sky
Right above our heads
While we're asleep
My mother and son pour into us
Pour into us
Warm glowing oil
Into our wide open throats

I have a recurrent dream

They make me feel better
They make me feel better


If there is a troubador washing
It is he
If there is a man about town
It is he
If there is one to be sought
It is he
If there are nine she is
They are bought for me

This way is as is she
And he placed her
Unclothed
Long long longlegged
On top of the family tree

And if he has chosen the point
While she is under him
Then leave her coily placed crouched sucking him
For it is I with
Her on knee

[Icelandic part]

I leave her
Without pith or feel
And leave her be
Leave it be
For he controls what there'll be
He makes his face known to none
For if he is seen
Then all will
And all will know
Know me


One hand allows the other
So much and me

Born stubborn me
Will always be
Before you count
One two three
I will have grown my own private branch
Of this tree

You gardener
You discipliner
Domestically
I can obey all of your rules
And still be, be

I never thought I would compromise
I never thought I would compromise
I never thought I would compromise

Let's unite tonight
We shouldn't fight
Embrace you tight
Let's unite tonight

I thrive best hermit style
With a beard and a pipe
And a parrot on each side
But now I can't do this without you

I never thought I would compromise
I never thought I would compromise
I never thought I would compromise

Let's unite tonight
We shouldn't fight
Embrace you tight
Let's unite tonight

One hand allows the other
So much and me

Let's unite tonight
We shouldn't fight
Embrace you tight
Let's unite tonight

Let's unite tonight
We shouldn't fight
Embrace you tight
Let's
Ooohhhh ooohh

Unison
Unison

The pleasure is all mine 
To get to be the generous one 
Is the strongest stance 
The pleasure is all mine 
To finally let go 
And defend me 
We float 

Who gives most 
Who gives most 
Who gives most 

The pleasure is all mine 
Women like us 
We strengthen most 
host-like 
When in doubt give 

When in doubt give 
When in doubt give


Show me forgiveness
For having lost faith in myself
And let my own interior up
To inferior forces
The shame is endless
But if soon stars forgiveness
The girl might live


Where is the line with you? 
Where is the line with you? 
Where is the line with you? 
Where is the line with you? 

My purse wide open 
You ask again 
I see you trying to 
Cash into accounts 
Everywhere 

Where is the line with you? 
Where is the line with you? 
Where is the line with you? 
Where is the line with you? 

I want to be flexible 
I want 
To go out 
Of my way for you 
But enough is enough 

Where is the line with you? 
Where is the line with you? 
Where is the line with you? 
Where is the line with you? 

I am elastic 
I want to go out of my way for you 
I want to help you 

Where is the line with you? 
Where is the line with you? 
Where is the line with you? 
Where is the line with you? 

I want to have capacity for you 
And be elastic, elastic, to be elastic for you 
Where is the line with you ? 

I'm elastic for you 
But enough is enough 

Where is the line with you? 
Where is the line with you? 
Where is the line with you? 
Where is the line with you?


His embrace, a fortress
It fuels me
And places
A skeleton of trust
Right beneath us
Bone by bone
Stone by stone
If you ask yourself patiently and carefully:
Who is it ?
Who is it that never lets you down ?
Who is it that gave you back your crown ?
And the ornaments are going around
Now they're handing it over
Handing it over

He demands a closeness
We all have earned a lightness
Carry my joy on the left
Carry my pain on the right

If you ask yourself patiently and carefully:
Who is it ?
Who is it that never lets you down ?
Who is it that gave you back your crown ?
And the ornaments are going around
Now they're handing it over
Handing it over


One breath away from mother Oceanðòa 
Your nimble feet make prints in my sands 
You have done good for yourselves 
Since you left my wet embrace 
And crawled ashore 
Every boy, is a snake is a lily 
Every pearl is a lynx, is a girl 
Sweet like harmony made into flesh 
You dance by my side 
Children sublime 
You show me continents 
I see islands 
You count the centuries 
I blink my eyes 
Hawks and sparrows race in my waters 
Stingrays are floating 
Across the sky 
Little ones, my sons and my daughters 
Your sweat is salty 
I am why 
I am why 
I am why 
Your sweat is salty 
I am why 
I am why 
I am why


When will it be time do document, do it now! 
This submarine behaviour, do it now! 
When time? 
To return 
Do it now 
Do it now 
Shake us out of the heavy deep sleep 
Shake us now 
Do it now! 
Do it now! 

Shake us out of the heavy deep sleep 
Do it now! 
Do it now!


It may not always be so
And I say that if your lips
Which I have loved
Should touch another's
And your dear strong fingers clutch his heart
As mine in time not far away

If on another's face your sweet hair lay
In such a silence as I know
Or such great writhing words as, uttering overmuch
Stand helplessly before the spirit at bay

If this should be, I say if this should be
You of my heart, send me a little word
That I may go unto her, and take her hands saying
Accept all happiness from me
Then shall I turn my face
And hear one bird sing terribly afar in the lost lands


It's tricky when
You feel someone
Has done something 
On your behalf 

It's slippery when 
Your sense of justice 
Murmurs underneath 
And is asking you:

How am I going to make it right? 

With a palm full of stars 
I throw them like dice
Repeatedly
I shake them like dice
And throw them on the table 
Repeatedly
Repeatedly
Until the desired constellation appears 
And I ask myself:

How am I going to make it right?
How am I going to make it right?
How am I going to make it right?
And you hear
How am I going to make it right?


There is yet another one 
That follows me 
Where ever I go 
And supports me 
This tooth is warmth-like 
And these teeth are a ladder up to his mouth 
These teeth are a ladder that I walk 
That you can walk too if you want 
If you want up to the mouth 
The mouth's cradle 
Up to the mouth's cradle 
He always has a hope for me 
Always sees me when nothing else 
And everyone have left 
That ghost is brighter than anyone 
And fulfils me with hope 

And you can use these teeth as a ladder 
Up to the mouth's cradle, the mouth's cradle 
And you can follow these notes i'm singing 
Up to the mouth's cradle, the mouth's cradle 
The simplicity of the ghost-like beast 
The purity of what it wants and where it goes 

Always love, always loves you, always loves you 
Infrared love 

And you can use these teeth as a ladder 
Up to the mouth's cradle, the mouth's cradle 
And you can use these teeth follow my voice 
Tooth by tooth 
Up to the mouth's cradle, the mouth's cradle 

I need a shelter to build an altar away 
From all osamas and bushes


The nerves are sending shimmering signals
All through my fingers
The veins support
Blood that gushes impulsively towards
Is the triumph of a heart that gives all
That gives all
The triumph of a heart that gives all
That gives all
The stubborn trunks of these legs of mine
Serve as pathways for my favourite fuel
Heading upwards towards my kidneys
(That celebrate)
The triumph of a heart that gives all

Smooth soft red velvety lungs
Are pushing a network of oxygen joyfully
Through a nose, through a mouth
But all enjoys, which brings us to
The triumph of a heart that gives all
That gives all


We are the earth intruders
We are the earth intruders
Muddy with twigs and branches

Turmoil! Carnage!

Here come the earth intruders
We are the paratroopers
The beat of sharp shooters
Come straight from voodoo

With our feet thumping
With our feet marching
Grinding skeptics
Into the soil

Shower of goodness coming to
End the doubt pouring over
Shower of goodness coming to end

We are the earth intruders
We are the sharp shooters
Flock of parachuters
Necessary voodoo

I have guided my bones through some voltage
And love them still
And love them too

Metallic! Carnage! Furiocity! Feel the speed!

We are the earth intruders
We are the sharp shooters
Flock of parachuters
Necessary voodoo

There is turmoil out there
Carnage, rambling
What is to do but dig
Dig bones out of earth

Mud graves! Timber! Morbid trenches!

Here come the earth intruders
There'll be no resistance
We are the canoneerers
Necessary voodoo

And the beast
With many heads
And the arms rolling
Steamroller!

We are the earth intruders
We are the earth intruders
Muddy with twigs and branches

Forgive us, tribe

We are the earth intruders
We are the earth intruders
Muddy with twigs and branches
Marching


I am leaving this harbour
Giving urban a farewell
Its habitants seem to keen on God
I cannot stomach their rights and wrongs

I have lost my origin
And I don't want to find it again
Whether sailing into nature's laws
And be held by ocean's paws

Wanderlust! relentlessly craving
Wanderlust! peel off the layers
Until we get to the core

Did I imagine it would be like this?
Was it something like this I wished for?
Or will I want more?

Lust for comfort
Suffocates the soul
Relentless restlessness
Liberates me (sets me free)

I feel at home
Whenever the unknown surrounds me
I receive its embrace
Aboard my floating house

Wanderlust! relentlessly craving
Wanderlust! peel off the layers
Until we get to the core

Did I imagine it would be like this?
Was it something like this I wished for?
Or will I want more?

Wanderlust! from island to island
Wanderlust! united in movement
Wonderful! I'm joined with you

Wanderlust!

Can you spot a pattern?

(relentlessly restless)


I love your eyes, my dear
Their splendid sparkling fire

When suddenly you raise them so
To cast a swift embracing glance

Like lightning flashing in the sky
But there's a charm that is greater still

When my love's eyes are lowered
When all is fired by passion's kiss

And through the downcast lashes
I see the dull flame of desire


I once had no fears
None at all
And then when
I had some

To my surprise
I grew to like both
Scared or brave
Without them

The thrill of fear
Thought I'd never admit it
The thrill of fear
Now greatly enjoyed with courage

When I once was
Untouchable
Innocence roared
Still amazes

When I once was
Innocent
It's still here
But in different places

Neurosis
Only
Attaches
Itself to
Fertile
Ground
Where it can flourish

The thrill of fear
Thought I'd never admit it
The thrill of fear
Now greatly enjoyed with courage

When I once was
Fearless
Innocence roared
Still amazes

Untouchable
Innocence
It's still here
But in different places

Fear is a powerful drug
Overcome it and
You think that you can do
Anything!

Should I
Save myself
For later
Or generously give?

Fear of
Losing
Energy
Is draining

It locks up your chest
Shuts down the heart
Miserly
And stingy
Let's open up : share!

When I once was
Fearless
Innocence roared
Still amazes

Untouchable
Innocence
It's still here
But in different places


I see who you are
Behind the skin
And the muscles

I see who you are, now
And when you get older later

I will see the same girl
The same soul
Lioness, fireheart
Passionate lover

And afterwards
Later this century
When you and I have become corpes

Let's celebrate now all this flesh on our bones
Let me push you up against me tightly
And enjoy every bit of you

I see who you are


Up on the toe
There is a view
Up on the toe
And the spine

Straight and erect
Hungry and curious
Up on the toe
Looking forward to

The air is thinner here

She came here
To lose face
Got down on her knees
The beast is back!

On four legs
Set her clock to the moon
Raises her spine

Vertebrae by vertebrae
Up on the toe
Looking

I have been filled with steam for months, for years
Same old cloud, claustrophobic me
Let it burst like old train sounds
Make them leave me nature

Vertebrae by vertebrae by vertebrae

My arms squeeze out of my shoulders!

And the arms squeeze out of my shoulders
I curl my tail in words
I set my clock on the moon
Vertebrae by vertebrae

Please release this pressure of me

Let off some steam


Get over that sorrow, girl
The world is always going to be made of this

You can trust in it
Unless you breathe in
Bravely

I adore how you simply surrender to high

And your lungs
They're mourning
Teepee-style

All the still-born love that could've happened
All the moments you should have embraced
All the moments you should have not locked up

Understand
So clearly
To shut yourself up
Would be the hugest crime of them all
You're just crying after all
To not want them humans around
Anymore

Get over that sorrow, girl


Here's my version of it, eternal whirlwind

What's the lesser of two evils:
If a suicide bomber
Made to look pregnant
Manages to kill her target
Or not?

What's the lesser of two evils?

What's the lesser of two evils:
If she kills them
Or dies in vain?

Nature has fixed no limits on our hopes

What's the lesser of two evils?

What's the lesser of two evils:
If the bomb was fake
Or if it was real?

Here's my version of it
Eternal whirlwind
I have fostered since childhood

Well I don't care
Love is all
I dare to drown
To be proven wrong

Down the corridor
I send warmth
I send warmth

Down the staircase
I send warmth
I send warmth

Thank you for, again
To get to be able
To send warmth
To send warmth

Perhaps I set you too free
Too fast
Too young

But the intentions were pure
But the intentions were pure

My juvenile
I truly say
You are my biggest love

I clumsily try to free you from me
One last embrace
To tie a sacred ribbon

This is an offer to better the last let-go

The intentions were pure

My juvenile


Like a virus needs a body
As soft tissue feeds on blood
Some day I'll find you, the urge is here
Ooo-ooo-ooo-oooh
Ooo-ooo-ooo-oooh

Like a mushroom on a tree trunk
As the protein transmutates
I knock on your skin, and I am in
Ooo-ooo-ooo-oooh
Ooo-ooo-ooo-oooh

The perfect match, you and me
I adapt, contagious
You open up, say welcome

Like a flame that seeks explosives
As gunpowder needs a war
I feast inside you, my host is you
Ooo-ooo-ooo-oooh
Ooo-ooo-ooo-oooh

The perfect match, you and I
You fail to resist
My crystalline charm

Like a virus, patient hunter
I'm waiting for you, I'm starving for you
Ooo-ooo-ooo-oooh
Ooo-ooo-ooo-oooh

My sweet adversary, ooh
My sweet adversary, oh
My sweet adversary

Ooo-ooo-ooo-oooh



Heaven, heaven's bodies
Whirl around me, make me wonder
And they say back then our universe was an empty sea
Until a silver fox and her cunning mate
Began to sing a song that became the world we know

Heaven, heaven's bodies
Whirl around me, make me wonder
And they say back then our universe was a cold black egg
Until the god inside burst out and from its shattered shell
He made what became the world we know

Heaven, heaven's bodies
Whirl around me, make me wonder
And they say back then our universe was an endless land
Until our ancestors woke up and before they went back to sleep
They carved it up into the world we know

Heaven, heaven's bodies
Whirl around me make me wonder
And they say back then our universe wasn't even there
Until a sudden bang and then there was light, was sound, was matter
And it all became the world we know

Heaven, heaven's bodies
Whirl around me and dance eternal



Stirring at water's edge,
Cold froth on my twig,
My mind in whirls
Wanders around desire.

May I, can I, or have I too often?
Craving miracles…
May I, can I, or have I too often now?
Craving miracles…
Craving miracles…

No one imagines the light shock I need,
And I'll never know
From who's hands, deeply humble,
Dangerous gifts as such to mine come.

May I, should I, or have I too often?
Craving miracles…
May I, can I, or have I too often?
Craving miracles…
Craving miracles..

My romantic gene is dominant
And it hungers for union,
Universal intimacy,
All embracing.

May I, should I or have I too often
Craved miracles?
May I, can I or have I too often
Craved miracles?
Crave…

Waves irregularly striking,
Wind stern in my face.
Thunderstorm, come,
Scrape those barnacles of me!

May I, may I or should I too often
Crave miracles?
May I or should I or have I too often

All my body parts are one
As lightning hits my spine,
Sparkling
Prime runs through me,
Revive my wish
Inviolable.

May I, can I, or have I too often?
Craving miracles…
May I, can I, should I, or have I too often?
Craving miracles…


As the lukewarm hands of the gods
Came down and gently picked my adrenalin pearls
They placed them in their mouths and rinsed all the fear out
Nourished them with their saliva

As if the healthiest past time
Is being in life-threatening circumstances
And once again be reborn
All birthed and happy (all birthed and happy)
All birthed and happy (all birthed and happy)
All birthed and happy (all birthed and happy)

Best way to start-a-new is to fail miserably
Fail at loving and fail at giving
Fail at creating a flow then realign the whole
And kick into the start hole, and kick into the start hole
And kick into the start hole

To risk all is the end all and the beginning all
To risk all is the end all and the beginning all


Underneath our feet
Crystals grow like plants
(Listen how they grow)
I'm blinded by the lights
(Listen how they grow)
In the core of the earth
(Listen how they grow)

Crystalline
Internal Nebula
(Crystalline)
Rocks growing slow-mo
(Crystalline)
I conquer claustrophobia
(Crystalline)
And demand the light

We mimic the openness
Of the warmth we love
Dovetail our generosity, equalizes the flow
With our hearts
We chisel quartz
To reach love

Crystalline
Internal nebula
(Crystalline)
Rocks growing slow-mo
(Crystalline)
I conquer claustrophobia
(Crystalline)
And demand the light

Octagon, polygon
Pipes up an organ
Sonic branches
Murmuring drone
Crystallizing galaxies
Spread out like my fingers

Crystalline
Internal nebula
(Crystalline)
Rocks growing slowmo
(Crystalline)
I conquer claustrophobia
(Crystalline)
And demand the light

Internal nebula
(Crystalline)
Rocks growing slow-mo
(Crystalline)
I conquer claustrophobia
(Crystalline)
And demand the light

It's the sparkle you become
Conquer anxiety
Sparkle you become
Conquer anxiety

Sparkle you become
When you conquer anxiety
It's the sparkle you become
When you conquer anxiety


Hollow, my ancestors have access
Hollow, I'm falling down the abyss
Hollow, looking for some answers
Generations of mothers sailing in
Somehow they all were shipfolks
Hollow, the ground is opening up
Swallows, me up, the trunk of DNA
The trunk of DNA, truck

Now come forth, all species
Hollow like a bead in necklace
Thread me upon this chain
I'm part of it, ohh
The everlasting necklace
Jewels after jewels after jewels after
Jewels after jewels after jewels
I yearn to belong, let me belong, let me belong


Why can't you give her room?
Respect her spatial needs.
I feel you compress her
Into a small space.

With clairvoyance,
She knew what you needed,
And gave it to you.
Now her desires are repressed;
Arrows in the flesh

When she found your love,
Her nature bowed her head;
She surrendered,
She renounced the world for you,
Now she's poisoned by demands
You cannot answer.

Why this sacrifice?
Now she regrets the whole thing,
A delayed reaction
When she left her craft voluntarily
For your nest, for your love.
Did you understand?

Appreciate,
Build a bridge to her.
Initiate a touch
Before it's too late,
Say the words to her
That will make her shine.

Tell her that you love her.

Your generosity will show
In the volume of her glow.


I shuffle around the tectonic plates in my chest.

You know I gave it all,
Try to match our continents
To change seasonal shift,
To form a mutual core.

As fast as your fingernail grows,
The Atlantic ridge drifts
To counteract distance.

You know I gave it all,
Can you hear the effort of the magnetic strife?
Shuffling of columns
To form a mutual core.

This eruption undoes stagnation.
You didn't know I had it in me,
Withheld your love, an unspent capsule.
I didn't know you had it in you,
You hid the key to our continuity.
I didn't know you had it in you.
This eruption undoes stagnation.
You didn't know, you didn't know.

What you resist persists, nuance makes heat
To counteract distance
I know you gave it all,
Offered me harmony if things were done your way.
My Eurasian plate subsumed,
Forming a mutual core

This eruption undoes stagnation.
You didn't know I had it in me,
Withheld your love, an unspent capsule.
I didn't know you had it in you.
This eruption undoes stagnation
You didn't know I had it in me
This eruption undoes stagnation
You didn't know, you didn't know.


When your eyes pause on the ball
That hangs on the third branch from the star,
You remember why it is dark
And why it gets light again.

The Earth, like the heart, slopes in it's seat
And, like that, it travels along an elliptical path
Drawn into the darkness.

An unpolished pearl
In sky-black
Palm of hand
Flickering sun-flame.

And then you remember
That you, yourself, you are a light-bearer, a light-bearer
Receiving radiance from others

Flickering sun-flame.

Unpolished Earth in palm of hand.


A juxtapositioning fate
Find our mutual coordinate

Moments of clarity are so rare
I better document this
At last the view is fierce
All that matters is

Who is open chested
And who has coagulated
Who can share
And who has shut down the chances

Show me emotional respect
I have emotional needs
I wish to synchronize our feelings

What is it that I have
That makes me feel your pain
Like milking a stone
To get you to say it

Who is open
And who has shut up
And if one feels closed
How does one stay open

We have emotional need
I wish to synchronize our feelings
Show some emotional respect


Maybe he will come out of this
Maybe he won't 
Somehow I'm not too bothered 
Either way

Maybe he will come out of this loving me 
Maybe he will come out of this
I smell declarations of solitude
Maybe he will come out of this

Vietnam vet comes after the war
Lands in my house 
This wild lion doesn't fit in this chair

Maybe he will come out of this loving me 
Maybe he won't 
I'm not taming no animal
Maybe he will come out of this

One it wat simple 
One feeling at a time 
It reached it's peal then transformed 
These abstract complex feelings
I just don't know 
How to handle them 
Should I throw oil 
On one of his moods 
But which one 
Make the joy peak 
Humour peak
Frustration peak 
Anything peak 
For clarity 

Maybe he will come out of this loving me 
Maybe he won't 
I'm not taming no animal 
Maybe he will come out of this 

Maybe he will come out of this 
Maybe he won't 
Somehow I'm not too bothered 
Either way

I refuse it's sign of maturity
To be stuck in complexity

I demand clarity
Either way

Maybe he will come out of this 
Somehow I'm not too bothered 
I'd just like to know


I wake you up
In the middle of the night 
To express my love for you
Stroke your skin and feel you 
Naked I can feel all of you
At same moment 

I wake you up
In night feeling 
This is our last time together
Therefore sensing all the moments
We've been together
Being here at the same time 
Every single touch
We ever touch each other
Every single fuck 
We had together 
Is in a wondrous time lapse 
With us here at this moment 
The history touches 
Every single archive
Compressed into a second 
All with us here as wake you up


Our love war my womb 
But our bond has broken 
My shield is gone 
My protection taken 
I am one wound 
My pulsating body 
Suffering being 

My hear is enormous lake 
Black with potion 
I am blind
Drowning in this ocean 

My soul torn apart 
My spirit is broken 
Into the fabric of all
He is woven 
Your fear my limitless emotions 
I'm bored of your apocalyptic obsessions 
Did I love you too much 
Devotion bent me broken 
So I rebelled 
Destroyed the icon 

I did it for love, honored my feelings 
You betrayed your own heart 
Corrupted that organ 

Family was always our sacred mutual mission 
Which you abandoned 

You have nothing to give
Your hear is hollow 
I'm drowned in sorrows 
No hope in sight of ever recover 
Eternal pain and horrors

I am a glowing shiny rocket 
Returning home 
As I enter the atmosphere 
I burn off layer by layer 
Jettison


Is there a place
Where I can pay respects
For the death of my family
Show some respect 
Between the three of us
There is the mother and the child
Then there is the father and the child
But no man and a woman
No triangle of love

So where do I go
To make an offering
I fall on my knees
And lay my flowers
Burn incense
Light the candles

So where do I go
To make an offering
To mourn our miraculous
Triangle
Father, mother, child

How will is sing us
Out of this sorrow
Build a safe bridge
For the child
Out of this danger
Danger

I raise a monument of love
There is a swarm of sound
Around our heads
And we can hear it
And we can get healed by it
It will relieve us from the pain
It will make us a part of
This universe of solutions
This place of solutions 
This location of solutions


Once you fell out of love
Our love couldn't carry you
And I didn't even notice
For our love
Kept me save from death

You doubted the light
And the shelter it can give
For in love we are immortal
Eternal and safe from death

If I regret us
I'm denying my soul to grow
Don't remove my pain
It is my chance to heal

After our love ended 
Your arms don't carry me
Without love I feel the abyss
Understand your fear of death 

We carry the same wound
But have different cures
Similar injuries 
But opposite remedies

I will not forget 
This notget
Will you not regret
Having love let go

After our love ended 
Your spirit entered me
Now we are the guardians 
We keep her safe from death 

Love will keep us safe from death


We are each others hemispheres

I am finetuning my soul
To the universal wavelength
No one is a lover alone
I propose an atom dance

Our hearts are coral reefs in low tide 
Love is the ocean we crave
Restlessly turning around and around
I am dancing towards transformation 

Learning by love to open it up
Let this ugly wound breathe
We fear unconditional heart space
Healed by atom dance

When you feel the flow as primal love
Enter the pain and dance with me
We are each others hemispheres

We aim at peeling off
Dead layers of loveless love 
No one is a lover alone
Most hearts fear their own home 
Becoming themselves fully
It scares them off

When you feel the flow as primal love
Enter the pain and dance with me
We are each others hemispheres

No one is a lover alone
Most hearts fear their own home
You are my second hemisphere
The atoms are dancing

No one is a lover alone 
Most hearts fear their own home


My throat was stuffed
My mouth was sewn up
Banned from making noise
I was not heard 

Remove this hindrance 
My throat feels stuck
I was not allowed
I was not heard

There is vocal sadness
I was separated
From what I can do
What I'm capable of

Need to break up
Vicious habits 
Do something
I haven't done before

In vow of silence
Explore the negative space
Around my mouth
It implodes
Black hole
With jaw fallen in 
In fallen jaw
Jaw fallen in
I am not hurt

This tunnel has enabled
Thousands of sounds
I thank this trunk 
Noise pipe

I have followed a path
That took sacrifices 
Now I sacrifice this scar
Can you cut it off


Define her abyss
Show it respect
Then a celestial nest 
Will grow above

When I'm broken I am whole
And when I'm whole I'm broken 

Our mother's philosophy 
It feels like quicksand
And if she sinks
I'm going down with her

Locate her black lake
The steam from this pit
Will form a cloud
For her to live on

When she's broken she is whole
And when she's whole she's broken

Our mother's philosophy
It feels like quicksand
And if she sinks
I'm going down with her

Hackle this darkness
Up to the light
Where choreographed oxygen
Embroiders the air

When we're broken we are whole 
And when we're whole we're broken

We are the siblings of the sun
Lets step into this beam
Every time you give up 
You take away our future
And my continuity and my daughter's
And her daughters
And her daughters...


You've got yourself in a fine mess now
Charlene
You're either absolutely mad or you are joking
Charlene

Charlene I'm crying so close to you darling
we're naked and laughing you shine on my batteries
Charlene

I have always adored your witty mouth
Charlene
Would you please be very very rude to them
Charlene

Charlene I'm crying so close to you darling
we're naked and laughing you shine on my batteries
Charlene

Let me get you out of that lake
Charlene
Your dress is red and oh so slippery
Charlene

I guess I have to dry you, dress you and comb you
you're already late, I'll sort you out

Charlene I'm crying so close to you darling
we're naked and laughing you shine on my batteries
Charlene


Oh boy, where have I put my keys?
I've looked in my pocket, 
behind the newspaper 
and underneath the remote control 
and I can't find where I put 'em again

Oh boy, I can not find my keys...
I'm far too late...
The door is open now,
a taxi is waiting there...

And the phone keeps ringing
I'm definitely not going to pick it up
Cuz, when I grow up
I'm going to get those fancy key rings
that you whistle at
and they whistle right back at you...


I go humble 
You're so curiously pure 
Only before you I'm humble 

I go humble 
You amaze me 
Only before you I go humble 

I should be arrested 
For my emotional stance 
Only before you I go humble 

I'm queen of provocation 
I wake people up 
Only before you I go humble 

I go humble 
I adore you 
Only before you I go humble 

I should be arrested 
For my emotional stance 
Only before you I go humble


Look no further
Look no further
I look no further

Cruelest, almost
Always to ourselves
It mustn't get
Any better, off

It's in our hands
It always was
It's in our hands
In our hands

It's all there
In our hands
It's all there
In our hands

Well, now aren't we
Scaring ourselves
Unnecessarily?
Aren't we trying too hard?

'Cause it's in our hands
It's in our hands
It's all here
It's in our hands

Look no further
I look no further

It's in our hands
It always was
It's in our hands

It's in our hands
It's in our hands
It's in our hands


Oh, thou that bowest thy ecstatic face
Thy perfect sorrows are the world's to keep

Wherefore onto thy knee
Come weep with a prayer

Oh, thou that bowest thy ecstatic face
Thy perfect sorrows are the world's to keep

Wherefore onto thy knee
Come weep with a prayer

Mother heroic, mother glorious
Beholding in thy eye, immortal tears

Oh, thou that bowest thy ecstatic face, oh


It's bright in the middle
With a shell around it
It's called life

It goes wherever it wants to
Don't try to predict it
Then you'd offend it
It's meant to surprise

Nature is ancient, but surprises us all
Nature is ancient, but surprises us all, all, all

Rescue me
From level-headedness
An unnecessary luxury of being calm

Nature is ancient, but surprises us all
Nature is ancient, but surprises us all

She's got dark hairs on her head
And blood on her arms
She sneaks up from behind
Come on - you deserve it!

Nature is ancient, but surprises us all
Nature is ancient, but surprises us all
Nature is ancient, but surprises us all
Nature is ancient, but surprises us all

Nature is ancient
So ancient
Nature is ancient
Ancient


I adore
Back of necks
Beautifully shaven

Gives me
Always, always, always, always...
A pretty rush down my spine

All those boys
With fascinating fingers
Working creating
Touching their tools

Gives me
Always, always, always, always...
A pretty rush down my spine

Tell me stories
Play me the tunes
That cracked you up

Gives me
Always, always, always, always...
A pretty rush down my spine-HA!


He means tomorrow but says in a bit
and doesn't show up at all
He sets his watch to a comets orbit
and remembers to forget to call

No courage for love - To Scared to be happy
No courage for love - To Scared to be happy

I Do, do, I do, do

Your place or mine means heaven or hell
Two addresses somewhat apart
His homes dark and spiky hers clear as a bell
It's over before they can start

No courage for love - To Scared to be happy
No courage for love - To Scared to be happy

I do, don't, I do, don't

and tomorrow pass them by
and tomorrow pass them by
and tomorrow pass them by
and tomorrow pass them by


Close your eyes
Listen closely
All that you've learnt
Try to forget it

Fuck logic
Fuck logic
Bravo to instinct
And sweet intuition

[Icelandic]

What makes you tick?
Try to remember
All that you've learnt
Try to forget it

Believe in believing
Believe in instinct
And sweet intuition

[Icelandic]

And inside we're all still wet
Yearning and longing
Repeat after me

Fuck logic
Fuck logic
Bravo to instinct
And sweet intuition
Sweet intuition honey
Sweet intuition
Sweet
Sweet intuition honey
Sweet

[Icelandic]


With our fingers we make million holes
We run and we fall into pot holes
On a mission to savor the world, oh!
We peek at the sky through tree holes.

Comet! Oh, damn it!
The comet comes hurtling down
On a precious plot of earth.

Like the bugs in mother's flower bed
We walk on long legs over the sea bed
On our mission to save the world, oh!
We need milk and cakes and a warm bed.

Comet! Oh, damn it!
The comet comes hurtling down
On a precious plot of earth.

Grey leaves are too much
For any mother to handle
A father must pull
His black hat down over the eyes.
